        <h3>Who We Are</h3>
        <p>Robotics builds a solid foundation in engineering and technology and gives a real life perspective on math and science. Team 254 is a robotics team from San Jose, California comprised of over 100 high school students. We participate in FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology), VEX, and Zero Robotics, all of which are worldwide robotics competitions that contain thousands of teams and hundreds of thousands of students. These competitions strive to inspire young people to be leaders in the technological and scientific world. Our robotics program encourages innovation and fosters well-rounded life skills including self-confidence, communication, and leadership.</p>

                <h3>Over the past seventeen years...</h3>
                <p>
                    FIRST Team 254, “The Cheesy Poofs,” has grown from one of the smallest programs in the country, at a struggling high school, to a large multifaceted organization. In 1998, NASA engineers Bob Holmes and Steve Kyramarios joined Jason Morella, then an English teacher and now with the Robotics Education and Competition Foundation, in founding the Cheesy Poofs. When Broadway High School was downsized, the program moved to Bellarmine College Preparatory in the fall of 2000. Since then, the team has won the FIRST Chairman’s Award, the FIRST Championship, the VEX Championship Excellence Award, and more awards than any other team in the program. The team started with as few as 5 members, and from then, has grown to more than 120 students.

                <p>
                    Team 254 participates in the VEX Robotics competition as well as the ZERO Programming competition. The team excels in all these competition achieving top notch qualification and prestigious awards. In addition, all 120 members of the team are required to complete a set number of robotics related service hours. In the past two years, Team 254 students have completed more than 8,000 community oriented service hours, founded 3 elementary school robotics programs, and attended more than 130 events to demonstrate what Robotics is all about. Not only do Team 254 students acquire technical skill sets, they also learn the fundamentals of other corporate tasks, such as project management, leadership, team building, marketing, etc.

        <h3>More important than any competitive success or awards...</h3>
        <p>
            The students of Team 254 grow academically, intellectually, and socially. Team 254 members gain a better understanding, a greater respect, and a more profound appreciation of the benefits of a good education. Much like NASA and Bellarmine College Preparatory, FIRST and VEX are organizations which, in a profound way, inspire and motivate our students to avidly pursue their academic, career, and personal goals.

            <h3>Giving Back to the Community</h3>
            <p>Team 254 is very fortunate to possess certain resources not available to other teams. Because of this, our team is devoted to spreading our resources to other teams in the form of outreach. Team 254 has started and mentored many teams throughout the West Coast of the United States and Israel. As early as the first few years of the decade, members from Team 254 traveled to Hawaii and Alaska to spread the message of FIRST to the farthest corners of the country. Team 254 was also involved in the creation of the Western Regional Robotics Forum (WRRF), which provides services to many northern California teams and hosts the CalGames Off-Season Competition each year</p>

                <h3>Mentoring Teams</h3>
                <p>
                    Team 254 has started and mentored many teams throughout the West Coast of the United States and Israel. As early as the first few years of the decade, members from Team 254 traveled to Hawaii and Alaska to spread the message of FIRST to the farthest corners of the country. Team 254 was also involved in the creation of the Western Regional Robotics Forum (WRRF), which provides services to many northern California teams and hosts the CalGames Off-Season Competition each year.
                    <br /><br />
                    For example, 254 began helping Team 359, the Hawaiian Kids, in 1999, and mentored them until their 2011 Championship Chairman’s Award win, <strong>which marked the first time in FIRST history that a Hall of Fame team mentored another into the Hall of Fame.</strong>
                    <br /><br />
                    Team 971, inspired by 254’s commitment to excellence, began holding design reviews for other teams, inspired by the ones 254 gave them and other veteran and rookie teams in years past. They credit 254 for the inspiration and continue to collaborate with the team today.
                    <br /><br />
                    In addition, in the spirit of Coopertition, the FIRST robotics commitment to cooperation and competition, team mentors and students lead electrical, programming, CAD, competition analysis, and organizational workshops for local teams. For example, the team teaches classes at the WRRF workshops and the team’s mentors continue to provide extensive engineering support to teams 968 and 1868.
                    <br /><br />
                    Before the team ships off the robot to competition, Team 254 works with Team 1868 to organize a practice scrimmage at the NASA Ames Research Center so that other teams can better prepare for competition by fixing any problems and practicing their driving.
                    <br /><br />
                    Team 254 also mentors many FRC teams, both locally and over a distance. Furthermore, Team 254 mentors many First Lego League (FLL) and VEX Robotics Competition (VRC) teams throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. The team has mentored numerous FLL teams including those at St. Martin’s and St. Christopher middle schools.
                    <br /><br />
                    Besides work with individual teams, Team 254 has a 80% size practice field which we open up to other teams regularly. Besides an annual practice weekend and scrimmage on the last weekend of the build season, Team 254 is willing to work with any team so that they can come in when it fits their schedule. Team 254′s extensive mentoring throughout the years forms an integral part of its team history and we are proud to support many teams throughout the West Coast and throughout the world.
